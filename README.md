Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 2 start and end dates Season 2 of Fortnite’s Chapter 5 was set to launch on Friday, March 8, following the end of the first season at 5am UK time.However, this update came with an unusually chunky downtime, as Epic Games brought the new content up to speed. It meant Season 2 slipped into March 9, UK time, with the first players being able to get in at about 1am.Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 2 map.The second season of Fortnite Chapter 5 has a Greek mythology theme.

This has seeped into all the game’s teasers and is seen (almost) all over the map. You can draw a line from the map's top left to the bottom right. Each of the zones it intersects has been given a refresh.

The new season of Fortnite has arrived. It’s Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 2 and is called Myths & Mortals.It’s full of Greek gods and mythical characters, including god of the sky Zeus, Hades, Aphrodite and Cerberus.The map has been overhauled, complete with locations from Ancient Greece, and there’s a new way to get around the map too.

Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 2 Wings of Icarus

This season introduces new ways to traverse Fortnite’s map, the Wings of Icarus. This pick-up lets you fly around for a limited amount of time.

But as with a vehicle with limited fuel, the Wings of Icarus will run out — and you don’t want to be 300 feet up in the air when that happens.

Fortnite has also teased another supernatural pick-up, the Chains of Hades. However, that’s a weapon, not a mythical grappling hook.
Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 2 battle pass
The Myths & Mortals Battle Pass costs 950 V-Bucks and, as usual, the hardcore Fortnite players can earn up to 1500 V-Bucks by playing through the season.

You unlock the Cerberus skin (the dog-like Hound of Hades) by default on buying the Battle Pass — and then unlock the rest of the cast of Greek mythical characters as you play.

Each has multiple variations to be unlocked, including a LEGO version in LEGO Fortnite. Here’s the list of key characters in Season 5 Chapter 2:
